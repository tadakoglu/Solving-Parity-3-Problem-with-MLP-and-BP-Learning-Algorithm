# Solving-Parity-3-Problem-with-MLP-and-BP-Learning-Algorithm
I haved solved the Parity-3 problem using an artificial neural network called Multilayer Perceptron and populer learning algorithm Backpropagation algorithm. Hyperbolic tangent has been used as an activation(transfer) function .

You must start the app with ParityNStart.m file in MATLAB.
If MATLAB have a hard time to start parityNStart, you may have to shorten this dictionary name. It only should
include English characters without any blanks.
Best Regards.
